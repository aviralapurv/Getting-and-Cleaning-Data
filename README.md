# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.
Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.
Project Outcome
In sync with the requirements this project comprises:

a tidy data set based on the original data set: tidy_data.txt and tidy_data.csv (nicely formatted on GitHub)
an R script called run_analysis.R for performing the analysis
a code book called CodeBook.md that describes variables, data and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data
